Git: Delete a branch (local or remote)
To delete a local branch

COPY
git branch -d the_local_branch
To remove a remote branch (if you know what you are doing!)

COPY
git push origin :the_remote_branch
or simply use the new syntax (v1.7.0)

COPY
git push origin --delete the_remote_branch
Note
If you get the error error: unable to push to unqualified destination: 
the_remote_branch The destination refspec neither matches an existing ref on the remote 
nor begins with refs/, and we are unable to guess a prefix based on the source ref. 
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@repository_name'

perhaps someone else has already deleted the branch. Try to synchronize your branch list with

COPY
git fetch -p 
The git manual says -p, --prune After fetching, 
remove any remote-tracking branches which no longer exist on the remote.
